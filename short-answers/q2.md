# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
Yes, we can simply adjust the middle conditional of the for loop (i < 10) to instead read (i < 8), so that once i reaches 7, that will be the last iteration.
